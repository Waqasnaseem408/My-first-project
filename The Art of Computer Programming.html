      <p>At the end of 1999, these books were named among the best twelve
        physical-science monographs of the century by <a href="#">American Scientist</a>,
         along with: Dirac on quantum mechanics, Einstein on relativity,
         Mandelbrot on fractals, Pauling on the chemical bond, Russell and
         Whitehead on foundations of mathematics, von Neumann and Morgenstern
          on game theory, Wiener on cybernetics, Woodward and <br> Hoffmann on orbital
           symmetry, Feynman on quantum electrodynamics, Smith on the search for
            structure, and Einstein's collected papers. Wow! <br> <br> <a href="#">View
               “historic” publisher's brochure from the first edition of Volume
                1 (1968)</a> </p>

    <h3>eBook versions</h3>

<p>These volumes are now available also in portable electronic form, using PDF
   format prepared by the experts at Mathematical Sciences Publishers. Special
    care has been taken to make the search feature work well. Thousands of useful
     "clickable" cross-references are also provided — from exercises to their
      answers and back, from the index to the text, from the text to important
      tables and figures, etc. <br> <br>

Warning: Unfortunately, however, non-PDF versions have also appeared, against my
 recommendations, and those versions are frankly quite awful. A great deal of
 expertise and care is necessary to do the job right. If you have been misled
  into purchasing one of these inferior versions (for example, a Kindle edition),
   the publishers have told me that they will replace your copy with the PDF edition
    that I have personally approved. <b>Do not purchase eTAOCP in Kindle format if you
    expect the mathematics to make sense.</b> (The ePUB format may be just as bad; I
    really don't want to know, and I am really sorry that it was released.) Please
     do not tell me about errors that you find in a non-PDF eBook; such mistakes
     should be reported directly to the publisher. Some non-PDF versions also masquerade
      as PDF. You can tell an authorized version because its copyright page
       (with the exception of Volume 4 Fascicle 5) will say ‘Electronic version
        by Mathematical Sciences Publishers (MSP)’. <br> <br>

The authorized PDF versions can be purchased at www.informit.com/taocp. If you
 have purchased a different version of the eBook, and can provide proof of purchase
  of that eBook, you can obtain a gratis PDF verson by sending email and proof
  of purchase to taocp@pearson.com.</p>
